## Description
The Flappy Bird Game Project is a digital game that recreates the classic Flappy Bird game. It's relevant to media and digital arts as it involves game development, graphic design, and interactive media.
The repository contains a single Python file, flappy_bird_plus.py, where the game logic is implemented. Sound files, including flap-sfx.mp3, hit-sfx.mp3, point-sfx.mp3, and Background-music.mp3, are integrated to enrich the auditory experience.
## Key Features
-Realistic Bird Animation: The game features a realistic bird animation with wing flapping, enhancing the visual appeal of the gameplay.
-Sound Effects and Background Music: Immersive sound effects, including wing flaps, collisions, and point scoring, along with background music, contribute to a more engaging gaming experience.
Responsive Controls: The player can control the bird's flight by tapping the spacebar, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface.
##  Future areas of improvements
-Main Menu and High Scores: Enhancing the game with a main menu and high score tracking would improve the overall user experience.
-Sprite Customization: Allowing users to customize the bird sprite or introducing different themes could add variety to the game.
-Power-Up System: Introducing a simple power-up system, like temporary invincibility or speed boosts, could add an extra layer of excitement to the gameplay without overly complicating the mechanics.
