## Description
The Flappy Bird Game Project is a digital game that recreates the classic Flappy Bird game. It's relevant to media and digital arts as it involves game development, graphic design, and interactive media.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- The game will have a bird character that fly up and fall down.
- Feature 2
	- The game will feature pipe obstacles that the bird must navigate through
- Feature 3 
	- The game will keep track of the player's score based on how many pipes the bird passes through.

## Challenges
- Learning Game Development: Learning how to develop a game from scratch using a game development framework.
- Graphic Design: Creating appealing graphics and animations for the bird character and pipes.
- Game Physics: Implementing realistic game physics for the bird's movement and collision detection.
## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome is a fully functional Flappy Bird game with smooth animations, responsive controls, and a scoring system. It should be visually appealing and enjoyable to play.
Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The minimal viable outcome is a basic Flappy Bird game that allows the bird to jump and fall, avoid pipes, and keep score. It may have simple graphics and animations but should be functional.
